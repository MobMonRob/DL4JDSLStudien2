# PrePro

The PrePro DSL is designed to simplify calculations with time series and
is mainly applied for pre-processing data used in machine learning applications
(hence the name). PrePro is statically and strongly typed and is devised to be
used in an interoperability environment with another language, typically Java,
which passes its data to and from the DSL.

This is a repo to which the project was pushed after its termination.
